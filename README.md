## Description:
This app takes a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactors it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

## Installation:
1. Clone or download the source code.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run develop` to start the server.
4. Navigate to your localhost (http://localhost:3000) in your browser if the app doesn't open automatically.

## Usage:
```md
User Story:
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```

## Challenges:
The API call is working and the user can search based on input. However, the login/sign up forms are not functioning properly. I am also unable to deploy my app to Heroku. I may be having issues connecting to Mongo Atlas. This is something I will continue to debug in the future, but for time purposes, I am turning in the project as is.

## Contributions:
This app was created in conjuction with the coding boot camp program at the University of Kansas. Please contact me, Rebecca, directly for guidelines.
